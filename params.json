Add this in your app's build.gradle file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndependencies {\r\n\tcompile 'com.amqtech:perms-helper:1.0.2'\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n# How to Use\r\nTo launch the permissions activity, simply write the following code:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n// Sample set up that explains to the user that you need access to device location.\r\nnew PermissionsActivity(getBaseContext())\r\n\t// Your app name. You MUST set this, otherwise bad things will happen!\r\n    .withAppName(getResources().getString(R.string.app_name))\r\n    // The permissions you need\r\n    .withPermissions(new Permission(Permissions.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, Permissions.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION))\r\n    // Callback\r\n    .withPermissionFlowCallback(new PermissionsActivity.PermissionFlowCallback() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onPermissionGranted(Permission permission) {\r\n    \t\t// if the permission was granted\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void onPermissionDenied(Permission permission) {\r\n            // if the permission was denied\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n    // Set status bar color\r\n    .setStatusBarColor(Color.parseColor(\"#ffffff\"))\r\n    // Set status bar icon color - true = dark icons; false (default) = light icons\r\n    .isStatusBarLight(true)\r\n    // Set background color\r\n    .setBackgroundColor(Color.parseColor(\"#ffffff\"))\r\n    // Set background color behind the buttons\r\n    .setBarColor(Color.parseColor(\"#ffffff\"))\r\n    // Set main text color \r\n    .setMainTextColor(Color.parseColor(\"#444444\"))\r\n    // Set bar button text color\r\n    .setBarTextColor(Color.parseColor(\"#444444\"))\r\n    // Set navigation bar color\r\n    .setNavBarColor(Color.parseColor(\"#ffffff\"))\r\n    // Change color of icons - it is advised that this be the same color as your text\r\n    .setIconColor(Color.parseColor(\"#444444\"))\r\n    // Launch the permissions activity\r\n    .launch();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe color methods are optional, and have defaults already set. The `withAppName()`, `withPermissions()`, `withPermissionsFlowCallback()`, and `launch()` methods are required for the library to work properly. Also, these methods are called only once. You don't need to call `withPermissions()` for each permission you are requesting, but rather pass all of them in one method call. [Refer to the sample app](https://github.com/Andrew-Quebe/Permissions-Helper/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/com/amqtech/permissions/sample/MainActivity.java#L76) to see how this is done.\r\n\r\n## Default Explanations\r\nThe library comes preloaded with default permission explanations if you wish to use them.\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n// Example - you don't need a second parameter for using the default explanations.\r\nnew Permission(Permissions.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Java Documentation\r\nIf you would like to view the Javadocs for this library, [click here.](https://cdn.rawgit.com/Andrew-Quebe/Permissions-Helper/master/javadoc/index.html)\r\n\r\n# Contributions\r\nIf you'd like to contribute to this library, feel free to make a pull request with your changes. \r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nPatrick J - [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+PatrickJung42/about) | [Github](https://github.com/pddstudio)\r\n\r\nHeinrich Reimer - [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+HeinrichReimer) | [Github](https://github.com/HeinrichReimer)\r\n\r\n# Developer Info\r\nAndrew Quebe<br>\r\n[andrewquebe@amqtech.com](mailto:andrewquebe@amqtech.com)\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2016 Andrew Quebe\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Apps that use this library\r\nNone yet!

Please do not post alpha/beta opt-in links.\r\n\r\n# My Inspiration\r\n\r\nI was exploring the Android Auto app when I noticed the way they present required permissions to the user. That got me thinking that I could create a library that does exactly that. \r\n\r\n| (Google's Version) | (My Version) |\r\n|:------------------:|:----------:|\r\n|<img width=\"640\" src=\"https://github.com/Andrew-Quebe/Permissions-Helper/blob/master/artwork/google.png\"/>|<img width=\"640\" src=\"https://github.com/Andrew-Quebe/Permissions-Helper/blob/master/artwork/mine.png\"/>|\r\n",
